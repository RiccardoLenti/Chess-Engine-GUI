# Chess Engine GUI
This is a very simple chess engine written in Rust. It's a much simpler version of my actual Rust chess engine. The reason for why this is public is that I initially implemented a very basic GUI on top of the engine in order to use it. I eventually moved to a UCI interface and deleted the GUI, so this is the last version of my engine that still has the GUI.
